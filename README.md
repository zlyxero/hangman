"""Player One picks a secret word and draws lines representing each letter in the word(in this case the word is provided and stored in variable word).
The program will use an underscore to represent each line. Player Two tries to guess the word one
letter at a time. If Player Two guesses a letter correctly, the corresponding underscore is
replaced with the correct letter. If Player Two guesses incorrectly, Player One draws a piece
of a picture of a hangman (a person hanging). If Player Two completes the word before the
picture of the hangman is drawn, they win, if not they lose.
Are you ready to build Hangman? """
